# ðŸŽ¨ Artify â€“ Neural Style Transfer Web App

**Artify** is a deep learning-powered web application that transforms your photos into artistic masterpieces by applying the style of famous paintings such as _Starry Night_ or _La Muse_. It uses neural style transfer with a pretrained VGG19 model to merge content and style images.

## ðŸ§  How it works

Artify leverages the [Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) technique using a pretrained **VGG19** network from PyTorch. The algorithm minimizes a loss that blends:

- **Content loss**: how much the result resembles the original photo
- **Style loss**: how much the result reflects the texture of the selected painting
